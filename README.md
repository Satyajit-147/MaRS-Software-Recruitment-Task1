**#MaRS Task1**

**##Experience and Learnings**

Working with Git and GitHub using Linux commands was a hands-on experience. For this task I successfully initialized a repository, pushed all python files to the repository and authenticated my GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT). I've solved 2 easy questions, 5 medium questions and 1 hard question which helped my revise my basic Python programming concepts.
Through this process, I learned:
- How to navigate directories and create new files using Linux commands
- Generate PAT for authentication instead of having to enter the password each time
- Troubleshoot common Git errors (Eg: Incorrect branch name
- Learnt file handling concepts in Python

**##Steps Taken to Push FIles to GitHub**
1. Initialize Git in the repository (Command: git init)

   **Description:** Creates a new Git repository within the diretory (if not already initialized)
   

3. Check the Current Git Branch (Command: git branch)

   ![Initializing Git](branch.png)
   
   **Description:** Displays the active branch (main/master). If no branch exists, it's taken as main by default


5. List down the remote repositories (Command: git remote -v)

   **Description:** Displays the remote repository URLs linked to your local Git repository, showing both fetch and push destinations.


7. Add files (Command: git add .)

   ![Initializing Git](add.png)
   
   **Description:** Adds all the files in the current directory to the staging area preparing them for commit
   

9. Commit the Changes (Command: git commit -m "Initial commit")

    ![Initializing Git](commit.png)
   
   **Description:** Saves the changes made with a description (message) "Initial commit"
   

10. Link Local Repository to GItHub repository (Command: git remote add origin https://github.com/Satyajit-147/MaRS-Software-Recruitment-Task1.git)

    ![Initializing Git](remote_add_origin.png)
   
   **Description:** This command is to connect local Git repository to a remote GitHub repository


11. Push Files to GitHub (Command: git push -u origin main)

    ![Initializing Git](push.png)
   
   **Description:** The command uploads the commited changes from local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. -u enables pushing to be done without specifying the active branch


**##Bash Scripting**
For this task, I generated a random number between 0 and 100 for the battery level using the command RANDOM%101, followed by two if conditions. The first condition checks if the battery level is below 20% and displays an appropriate error message if the condition is met. The second condition pings google.com to check network connectivity. If both checks pass, the script prints "All systems operational"; otherwise, it exits with an error message.


**#MEDIUM DOSE**

**##Task1**

The task was to determine the adjusted coordinates of the Rover Brick. According to the problem, the rover made a 360-degree turn 55 cm behind the actual mark. To correct its position, I first calculated the direction vector from the initial reference point to the final position. Then, I computed the unit vector, multiplied it by 55, and added the result to the final rover coordinates to obtain the corrected position. The initial reference frame and the roverâ€™s final position before adjustment are taken as input from the user.
