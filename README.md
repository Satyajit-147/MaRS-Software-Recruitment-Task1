**#MaRS Task1**

**##Experience and Learnings**

Working with Git and GitHub using Linux commands was a hands-on experience. For this task I successfully initialized a repository, pushed all python files to the repository and authenticated my GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT). I've solved 2 easy questions, 5 medium questions and 1 hard question which helped my revise my basic Python programming concepts.
Through this process, I learned:
- How to navigate directories and create new files using Linux commands
- Generate PAT for authentication instead of having to enter the password each time
- Troubleshoot common Git errors (Eg: Incorrect branch name
- Learnt file handling concepts in Python

##Steps Taken to Push FIles to GitHub**
1. Initialize Git in the repository (Command: git init)
